PROJECT ONE: ONBOARDING
Project Description
You will create a compelling single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community. Focus on designing for an effortless, engaging entry of personal information; and friendly, frictionless client-side tests and alerts for malformed, missing, or incomplete information. The goal of this project is to experiment with patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is youâ€™re offering, which is not at all an easy task.

Project Goals
Create a touch-friendly, mobile-first responsive web design
Experiment with design and interaction patterns for pleasing user experience
Design and execute a progressively enhanced page focused on system users and tasks
Apply design principles including typography, color, and material design
Engage in agile, iterative web design and development, supported by version control
